# Tech Blog

## Description

I created this technology centered blog using Node.js, the express-handlebars package to use handlebars for my front end code, and MySQL2 and the sequelize package to connect to an express.js API. I used the dotenv package for environmental variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.
